# Asynchronous Code Testing

JavaScript asynchronous code is executed in the future, it may take some time to be completed.

Normally we use Callback functions or Promises to run asynchronous code.

We need to use the 'done' parameter to test async code with Callbacks

Test async code with propmises is easier, 'expect' supports promises out of the box
